# Information Visualization Techniques for Qualitative Data — Systematic Mapping Materials

This repository contains the datasets, extraction sheets, supporting files, and complementary materials used in the systematic literature mapping presented in:

**"Information Visualization Techniques for Qualitative Data: A Systematic Literature Mapping"**
Journal on Interactive Systems (JIS), 2026.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to promote **research transparency, reproducibility, and open science** by providing access to the materials used during the planning, selection, extraction, and analysis stages of the systematic mapping study.

The study investigates information visualization techniques applied to qualitative data, including:

* Visualization techniques
* Implementation tools
* Evaluation metrics
* Application contexts
* Contributions and limitations reported in the literature
